# PacMan
 Project for Computer Architecture

This work was done in assembly programming language and was subsequently assembled and run in the p3 processor simulator. The realization of this work contributed in a fundamental way to the understanding of the programming language in question and to the understanding of the functioning of a processor.

The project carried out consisted of programming the famous assembly pac-man game. The game aims to get the highest score possible. The player controls the pac-man, this being an “@”, when eating “.” (points) adds 2 points, when you eat “(“ (banana) adds 10, if you eat an “&” (pear) adds 20, finally when eating an “%” adds 30 points to the current score of the level in question, which can also be accumulated to the final score. As he accumulates points, pac-man and monsters move faster. To make this “adventurer’s” task more difficult, there are all the cost to prevent our "friend" from accumulating points. When the pac-man is caught by a monster the game is over and the maximum score (if it is higher than the one I had previously) is shown in the home menu. In addition, the game contains 3 levels, the 1st being the easiest and the 3rd the hardest.

The pac-man movement map in each level is delimited by “#” (walls), not allowing him to leave the map and eat what he shouldn't.
